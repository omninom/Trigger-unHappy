## Playing the Game
Start the game by running Game.pde from Processing.
Use the WASD to move, mouse to aim, mouse1 to fire.
Your bullets remain active after you shoot them, bouncing off the walls and damaging you if hit.
Shoot coins to increase score, don't be trigger happy, keep disciplined.

## Difficulty
Easy: Bullets disappear eventually
Hard: Bullets never disappear, 1 hit = death
